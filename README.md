Todo List application built with React. It allows users to add, check, and remove items from a list. The application features an input field where users can enter new items, and a list of todos that dynamically updates as items are added or removed. Each todo item has a checkbox to mark it as complete and a delete button to remove it from the list. Completed items are displayed separately at the bottom. The application has been deployed on Vercel, and you can access it here.
